            A blog (shortening of “weblog”) is an online journal or informational website displaying information in the reverse chronological order, with latest posts appearing first. It is a platform where a writer or even a group of writers share their views on an individual subject.
            <br><br>
            <h3 id="purpose">What is the purpose of a blog?</h3>
            There are many reasons for starting a personal blog and only a handful of strong ones for business blogging. Blogging for business, projects, or anything else that might bring you money has a very straightforward purpose – to rank your website higher in Google SERPs, a.k.a. increase your visibility.
            <br>
            As a business, you rely on consumers to keep buying your products and services. As a new business, you rely on blogging to help you get to these consumers and grab their attention. Without blogging, your website would remain invisible, whereas running a blog makes you searchable and competitive.
            <br>
            So, the main purpose of a blog is to connect you to the relevant audience.
            <br>
            Another one is to boost your traffic and send quality leads to your website.
            <br>
            The more frequent and better your blog posts are, the higher the chances for your website to get discovered and visited by your target audience. Which means, a blog is an effective lead generation tool. Add a great call to action (CTA), and it will convert your website traffic into high-quality leads.
            <br>
            But a blog also allows you to showcase your authority and build a brand.
            <br>
            When you use your niche knowledge for creating informative and engaging posts, it builds trust with your audience. Great blogging makes your business looks more credible, which is especially important if your brand is still young and fairly unknown. It ensures presence and authority at the same time.
            <br><br>
            <h3 id="structure">Blog structure</h3>
            The appearance of blogs changed over time, and nowadays blogs include different items. But, most blogs include some standard features and structure. Here are common features that a typical blog will include:
            <br>
            <br>Header with the menu or navigation bar
            <br>Main content area with highlighted or latest blog posts
            <br>Sidebar with social profiles, favorite content, or call-to-action
            <br>Footer with relevant links like a disclaimer, privacy policy, contact page, etc.
            <br>Basic blog structure
            <br>            Feel free to use this template on your site
            <br>
            Above example is the basic structure of the blog. Each item has its own importance and helps visitors to navigate through your blog.
            <br><br>
            <h3 id="websites">Blogs and websites</h3>
            A majority of people still wonder whether there is any difference between a blog and a website. What is a blog and what is a website? It’s even more challenging to differentiate between the two today. Many companies are integrating blogs into their sites to perform the same function.
            <br>
            What differentiates blogs from websites?
            <br>Blogs need frequent updates. Good examples include a food blog sharing meal recipes or a company writing about their industry news.
            <br>          
            Blogs promote perfect reader engagement. Readers get a chance to comment and voice their different concerns to the viewer. Static websites, on the other hand, consists of the content presented on static pages. Static website owners rarely update their pages. Blog owners update their site with new blog posts on a regular basis.
            <br>
            Key elements that identify a blog post from a static page include a publishing date, author reference, categories, and tags within a byline. While not all blog posts have all those byline elements, static website pages do not have any of these items.
            <br>
            From a visitor perspective, the content on a static site will not change from one visit to the next. The content on a blog, yet, has the potential to offer something new each day, week, or month. Depending on the blog owner’s publishing schedule.
